//Create a new project with 3 Java source files: superclass file, subclass file and test file with meaning file names. Include your class, adm No. and name as comments at the beginning of all your Java programs. Zip the 3 .java files in LT2p*.zip for submission, where * is your adm No.

//Task 1: Complete the following class
//class Vehicle{   
  //a ) declare a private instance variable wheelNo with suitable data type
    
  //b ) design a no-arg constructor to initialize instance variable with valid value. 

  //c ) design another constructor to initialize instance variable through its parameter    

  //d ) design accessor method which changes instance variable’s value through its parameter with no return value 
 
  //e ) design accessor method which takes no parameter but returns instance variable’s value

 //public void  describe( ) {
  /* f ) print instance variable value with proper description */
  //}
//} // end of class Vehicle

// Task 2: Design a subclass of Vehicle in Task 1 with the following requirements:

// Additional property (visibility: private )	double age
// A no-arg constructor	    to initialize the properties in both parent and child class with valid values
// Another constructor	    to initialize the properties in both parent and child class through its parameters
// Methods



// 	    accessor method which changes the additional property’s value through its parameter with no return value
// 	    accessor method which takes no parameter but returns the additional property’s value
// 	override describe( ) in super class to print all properties’ values  and following additional info,
//     if the age < 3: “It is relatively new.”
//     else if the age is >9: “It serves too long. Please drive it carefully.”
//     else if the age is >=7: “You may consider scrapping the car.”

// Task 3: Design a testing program to: 
//   a) create two objects from subclass in Task 2 using different constructors;  
// b) choose one of the objects created in a), print out its properties’ value with additional info by calling appropriate methods; 
//   c) call appropriate methods to change the properties’ values of the object used in b);  
//   d) display all properties’ values of object used in b) and additional info if any, again.
